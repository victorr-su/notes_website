# notes_website

A project built during Hack the North 2021

#What is this? 
- Our team decided to createa a project revolving around students as we all have common ground with that. We noticed that there were no reliable
methods to get notes, reviews, or any relevant material for university class, so we decided to build a website where previous students from univrsities 
all around the world can upload and share any relevent material for new students that plan on taking a class at a specific school.

#What technolgies were used to create this project?
- We build the front-end using React, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. The back-end was built using Django and Python
